# ROS mini projects


Project 1:

TASK: A turtlebot3 model robot explores the environment while creating a map that well covers the initially unexplored environment. 
The solution includes the following steps:
- Frontier identification based on LiDAR data,
- Path planning
- Controlling the robot to follow the planned path.

The project is done in Robotics Operating System (ROS). 
The visualization is in RViz.
The model of the environment and the turtlebot are provided by Gazebo.

The code is not shared upon request of the course instructor, but here's a video of the result:
