# ROS final project


**Task**: Cooperative agents generate opposing forces (via push rods) to move an egg along a prescribed trajectory. This task is implemented as part of the following study:

*Sheybani, S., Izquierdo, E., Roth E. (forthcoming 2020). Evolving Dyadic Strategies for a Cooperative Physical Task.  publication description IEEE Haptics Symposium.*

Objectives and Constraints
The egg should follow the target trajectory
Agents must not drop the egg. Hence, they must always exert some minimum pushing force.
Agents must not break the egg. The normal force on the egg must remain below some breaking threshold.
